Whether you’re generating a Candidate Assessment Report for a small team of 100 or a large crew of 500, or if you’re scheduling 200 shifts versus 2,000, the processing times differ. Given the diversity in requirements, a one-size-fits-all approach simply won’t work.\n\nFlexible Pricing for Every Need\n\nInstead of trying to guess your needs, we’ve introduced a flexible, transparent pricing model based on consumption. With our model, $5 is equivalent to 1 minute of processing. This ensures that you only pay for the actual computational effort required for your task, making our powerful AI models accessible for any size problem.",

    "longDescription": "# CopyAssure – Clean, Fast, and Secure Cyber Recovery for IBM PowerVS\n\n**CopyAssure** is Celerity’s advanced cyber recovery and data resilience solution for **IBM Power Virtual Server (PowerVS)** environments, supporting **IBM i, AIX, and Linux**.  \nBuilt for mission-critical workloads, CopyAssure delivers automated, verified recovery using continuously tested backup copies. Based on IBM’s **Cyber Vault blueprint**, it combines frequent data copies, immutable storage, cleanroom validation, and end-to-end orchestration—helping organisations recover with confidence from even the most disruptive cyberattacks and more.\n\nCopyAssure can also be leveraged to spin up clean, digital twin system copies for testing, development, or even **AI training**—without risking the integrity of the core environment.\n\nFind out more: https://celerity-uk.com/data-security-and-resilience/copyassure\n\n---\n\n### Key Features\n\n---\n\n### Scheduled Snapshots, Cloning & Exports with Continuous Testing\n\nCopyAssure orchestrates scheduled snapshots, volume clones, and optional image export to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) to provide layered, resilient recovery points with immutability. These are continuously tested to demonstrate recoverability within defined RPO and RTO thresholds.\n\nTo extend assurance further, the service includes automated system validation through a proprietary virtual operator. This technology emulates real user interactions—such as 5250 terminal sessions for IBM i, and interactive workloads for AIX and Linux—to verify that systems are fully operational post-recovery.\n\n---\n\n### Proactive Air-Gapped Copies\n\nCopyAssure leverages PowerVS volume clone technology to create logically air-gapped snapshots. This approach provides an additional layer of defence against ransomware and insider threats by ensuring backup copies are inaccessible from compromised systems.\n\n---\n\n### Immutable Data Protection\n\nCopyAssure supports image export to IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) using write-once, read-many (WORM) storage, providing immutable backup copies protected against tampering, deletion, or ransomware encryption. This capability supports long-term data integrity and aligns with regulatory and audit-readiness requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Continuous Recoverability Validation\n\nAligned with IBM’s Cyber Vault methodology, CopyAssure provisions secure cleanroom environments to validate cloned backups prior to restoration. This process proves that a system is fully recoverable through controlled boot procedures, OS-level checks, and bespoke validation of user activity and application services.\n\n**The validation framework includes multiple stages:**\n\n- **T1 – System Validation**: Confirms successful boot and core OS integrity  \n- **T2 – Application Validation**: Verifies application availability and service responsiveness  \n- **T3 – Data Validation**: Confirms access to critical data and consistency within key datasets\n\nThis multi-layered approach ensures only clean, operational recovery points are promoted for restoration.\n\n---\n\n### Fully Automated Workflow\n\nCopyAssure delivers end-to-end automation across backup validation and recovery orchestration. By removing manual steps, the service improves consistency, reduces human error, and accelerates recovery across complex environments—enabling repeatable, policy-driven execution at scale.\n\n---\n\n### NIST-Aligned Architecture\n\nCopyAssure is aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, supporting the core functions of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. This alignment helps organisations strengthen their cyber resilience strategy, meet regulatory expectations, and streamline audit readiness.\n\n---\n\n### Operational Continuity\n\nCopyAssure enables secure, verified recovery without interrupting production systems. All validation and testing occur in isolated cleanroom environments, ensuring non-disruptive assurance for high-availability workloads and regulated operations. This supports continuous business operations, even during threat response or audit preparation.\n\n---\n\n### Cost Efficiency\n\nCopyAssure helps reduce both direct and hidden costs associated with cyber recovery—including unplanned downtime, manual recovery labour, extended investigation cycles, and potential ransomware-related losses. Automated processes and cleanroom validation reduce operational burden while accelerating time-to-recovery.\n\n---\n\n### Peace of Mind\n\nWith immutable storage, automated cleanroom validation, and proven recovery workflows, CopyAssure gives organisations confidence that every restore point is secure, tested, and reliable. This assurance supports both operational resilience and regulatory compliance.\n",

A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your block storage volume. The entire contents of the volume are copied and retained. Subsequent snapshots will capture the incremental changes from the previous snapshots.\n\n#### Pricing\n\nYou will be charged for the storage capacity used for each of your backups.

This fully managed Desktop as a Service (DaaS) solution enables persistent, personal Windows 11 desktop experiences, built for hybrid work and maximum productivity. We offer two complementary tiers - Core and Complete - to fit every operational model.\n\n\nThe Core Tier is ideal for organizations that already have in-house IT operations, identity services, and endpoint management tools in place. If your team can handle monitoring, patching, and support with existing staff and systems, Core lets you spin up Cloud PCs in minutes - without overhauling your workflows. Companies with 25 or more users can choose from five performance-tuned configurations, plug into your existing AD or run as standalone, and deploy directly over the internet or via private networking.\n\n\nThe Complete Tier builds on the flexibility of Core with enterprise-grade management, security, and unlimited scalability for 50+ desktops, and requires Private Network Access per region. With Dizzion-managed services - Overwatch real-time observability & analytics, automated OS and Application patching, and self-service software deployment for up to two administrators - you get a truly hands-off Cloud PC experience. Tailored for organizations requiring centralized identity, granular performance controls, and seamless global expansion, the Complete Tier also offers a rich add-on catalog - from vulnerability monitoring to advanced firewalling - delivering a turnkey solution that scales with your business. The only elements you manage are end-user support and application deployment.\n\n\nWhether you are migrating from on-premises VDI or looking to modernize legacy PC deployments, Dizzion Cloud PC provides a seamless path forward with predictable pricing, great user experience, fast provisioning, simplified management, and deployment.\n\n\nFor sales support, reach out to Dizzion directly at sales@dizzion.com.",

You can create a custom image on premises and import it to your IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure from IBM Cloud Object Storage. \n2. You can create a custom image of a boot volume that is attached to a virtual server instance at import time. For more information, see [about creating an image](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-image-from-volume-vpc).\nImages are private to the account that they're imported to. New virtual server instance deployments are limited to the region where the image is imported.

For more information about managing custom images, see [Managing custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-managing-custom-images).\n\nYou have many considerations when you create a custom image, such as operating systems, image requirements, and whether you want to share your custom image to a private catalog.

Komprise is a data management service that connects easily via open standards to any file storage to provide much-needed analytics and visibility across all storage silos.\n\nKey benefits for customers include optimizing the management of petabytes of unstructured data to accelerate cloud migrations while dramatically cutting costs. Komprise automatically migrates or tiers unstructured/file data to secondary storage according to the plans which users create so that data always lives in the right place at the right time according to its age, usage or other parameters such as security.\n\nThis adds up to significant storage savings (up to 70%) from migrating and archiving data. Komprise’s elastic grid architecture and patented TMT (transparent move technology) ensures that once data is moved from NAS and cloud file services, users can always access files from the original location, in their original form, without getting in the hot data path and enabling native access in the destination storage.",

You can seamlessly scale your applications by adding or removing servers. with minimal to no disruption to existing traffic flows.\n\n##### Application load balancer (ALB)\n\nBoth public and private ALBs provide layer-7 and layer-4 load balancing on IBM Cloud, supporting SSL offloading. The incoming and outgoing packets flow through the load balancer, which distributes data traffic based on configured policies and rules. When incoming requests match the rules that are associated with a policy, that policy defines how the load balancer distributes its traffic.\n\n##### Network load balancer (NLB)\n\nAn NLB provides only layer-4 load balancing on IBM Cloud, and does not support SSL offloading. The NLB is zonal, which means that the members must be in the same zone as the load balancer. The client sends public network traffic to the NLB, which forwards it to its targets. These targets then respond directly to the client by using Direct Server Return (DSR). The load balancer does not perform a check on the contents of the packet. Since Layer 4 network load balancing only processes ingress traffic, it is ideal for workloads that require high throughput and low latency.\n\n[Compare offerings](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-nlb-vs-elb)",

    "longDescription": "Private Path service for VPC allows a provider’s service to connect on the IBM Cloud private  network, providing secure communication between VPCs and supported IBM Cloud and third-party services. The provider first deploys their service on IBM Cloud and creates a Private Path network load  balancer (NLB) to enable their service for private connectivity. Next, the provider creates a Private Path service to expose and control access to their service. After the Private Path service is verified and published, other accounts can then connect to the provider’s service through endpoint gateways.\n\nFor consumers to connect to a provider’s service, the provider must relay information to their consumers, such as the cloud resource name (CRN) that maps to the Private Path service and a port, if required. Consumers then privately connect to the service by creating a VPE gateway with the information provided. Next, the consumer's connection request is sent to the service provider for review (the default policy). If there is an account policy for the consumer, that policy takes precedence over the default policy (to review, permit, or deny access).  \n\nThe consumer can now access the service privately from their VPC, and the provider can host and manage consumer’ connections from within their own VPCs.",

ProtectIO is delivered as a web-accessible, multi-tenant, IBM Cloud-native Software-as-a-Service and helps customers by providing a robust disaster recovery solution while leveraging the latest cloud economics for an attractive Total Cost of Ownership.\n\nContinuous Data Protection (CDP) is delivered via PrimaryIO’s proprietary VAIO Replication filter and Authenticated Block Stream Protocol that ships the changed I/O blocks to a DR Receiver process in the Target/DR environment and commits to IBM Cloud Object Storage.\n\nAt failover time, ProtectIO rehydrates from the Cloud Object Storage buckets into the respective VMDKs and instantiates the VMs that compose the application workload that is being protected. This delivers near zero RPO and an RTO correlated with the amount of data that needs to be rehydrated, which provides a compelling Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) solution for customers.\n\nProtectIO supports on-premises, IBM Cloud Classic and IBM Cloud VPC as the Primary Site and utilizes IBM Cloud Classic or VPC for the Target/DR Site, depending upon the customer and available VPC capacity. The UI/UX and associated Control Plane, which runs in an IBM Cloud VPC,  has been designed to be extremely intuitive and allow customers to operate without needing assistance from a Managed Service Provider.\n\nPre-requisites:\n\n\t1. Customer needs to have a IBM tenant account\n\t2. Customer needs to have COS instance\nNote: PrimaryIO team will help you setup IBM tenant account and COS instance",

    "longDescription": "Trademo TradeScreen is an advanced AI-powered platform that revolutionizes how key stakeholders in global trade, i.e., Trade Finance, Insurance, Logistics, Ports, and Customs authorities, manage trade transaction processing, operations, compliance, and risk. \n\nBy leveraging Trademo's proprietary fine-tuned vision models and global supply chain knowledge graph (TrademoKG) powered by open-source intelligence from thousands of authoritative data sources and billions of data points, TradeScreen provides real-time trade digitization, compliance automation, and risk management capabilities.\n\nKey Features\n\nDocument Digitization & Classification\n\nOur system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to automatically classify trade documents into specific categories, completely eliminating the need for manual sorting. Whether it's a Bill of Lading (BoL), Letter of Credit (LC), Commercial Invoice, Packing List, Certificate of Origin, or any other trade document, our intelligent classification engine instantly recognizes and organizes them into the correct buckets. This not only speeds up processing times but also enhances accuracy and reduces operational overhead.\n\nDocument Extraction\n\nPowered by an advanced vision model combined with Optical Character Recognition (OCR), our system precisely extracts all the key attributes from your trade documents regardless of inconsistent formats and data structures. From shipment details and payment terms to product specifications and consignee information, the platform automates data extraction at scale, removing hours of manual effort and reducing the risk of human error. The result is faster workflows, more accurate data, and a significant boost in operational efficiency.\n\nMaritime\n\nValidate master bill of lading data and get details on transhipment ports, vessel location, and previous port calls of the vessel with the right information from shipping lines. Identify and mitigate risk by screening vessels and shipping entities flagged for maritime sanctions violations.\n\nCompliance & Risk Checks\n\nTBML (Trade-Based Money Laundering) Checks\n\nLeverage real-time trade transactional data to identify risk from supply chain networks, such as limited trade partners, new product trade, multiple addresses, and more. Identify patterns in trade data that could indicate fraudulent activity, such as huge shipments, frequent changes in trading partners, unusual payment patterns, or inconsistent documentation.\n\nGoods Screening\n\nEnsure compliant financing by thoroughly screening for dual-use, hazardous, restricted/prohibited goods across different trade lanes. Trademo empowers trade finance institutions by offering real-time insights into country-specific trade restrictions, OGA/PGA regulations, and controls to mitigate risks, accelerate due diligence, and facilitate secure, compliant cross-border transactions.\n\nSanctions & AML Screening\n\nConduct enhanced due diligence on parties with links to sanctioned countries, entities, individuals, politically exposed persons, and forced labor entities.\n\nUCP 600 Checks\n\nEnsure trade documents meet the standards outlined under UCP 600 rules for seamless processing.\n\nEntity Resolution\n\nTrademo’s Entity Resolution helps trade finance institutions uncover hidden risks by mapping ownership structures, identifying linked entities, and automatically screening them against global sanctions and watchlists. This end-to-end visibility strengthens due diligence, enhances compliance, and ensures safer financing decisions.\n\nDocument Verification as per ICC Rules (UCP, ISBP, URC)\n\nTrademo’s Document Check automates verification against UCP, URDG, URC, and ISBP rules as applicable, helping trade finance institutions quickly validate trade documents for compliance and accuracy. By reducing manual errors and speeding up document review, it ensures smoother letter of credit processing, lowers operational risk, and accelerates transaction approval.\n\nBenefits:\n\nCost Efficiency Through Automation\n\nBy reducing manual tasks by up to 75%, TradeScreen lowers the cost of transaction processing and fraud detection. This reduction leads to decreased overhead for organizations as they streamline their operations.\n\nFraud Prevention\n\nTradeScreen uses AI models to identify suspicious patterns before transactions are processed, enabling early intervention. This helps mitigate losses and prevent financial fraud, which is projected to cost the industry billions by 2027.\n\nImproved Accuracy & Fewer False Positives\n\nBy reducing false positives by up to 40%, TradeScreen ensures compliance teams spend less time investigating non-issues and more time focusing on actual risks, making institutions more efficient and productive.\n\nEnhanced Regulatory Compliance\n\nWith integrated tools for sanctions screening, goods checks, and supply chain transparency, TradeScreen helps financial institutions comply with AML, CTF, and sanctions laws, reducing the risk of regulatory penalties.\n\nIncreased Visibility Across Ecosystems\n\nTradeScreen merges data from multiple sources to provide a transparent view of the entire trade and financial ecosystem. This visibility helps institutions better understand their clients, suppliers, and third-party risks.\n\nSeamless Integration With Existing Infrastructure\n\nTradeScreen is an open, scalable platform that easily integrates with existing banking infrastructure, enabling institutions to leverage its capabilities without extensive system overhauls.'\n\nEnhanced Decision-Making\n\nThe platform delivers actionable insights and transparency into the participants in each transaction, empowering financial institutions to make informed decisions about trade transactions and client relationships.\n\n\nCapabilities\n\nGlobal Trade Risk Mitigation\n\nDetects and prevents risks in trade transactions using a comprehensive database of international regulations and risk checks.\n\n500+ Real-Time Compliance Checks\n\nPerform 500+ real-time checks to ensure trade transactions comply with global regulations, reducing risks and non-compliance.\n\nAI-Driven Knowledge Graph\n\nUnlock insights with an AI-powered graph integrating billions of data points on trade, supply chains, risks, and ownership.\n\nEnd-to-End Transaction Validation\n\nValidate every aspect of trade transactions, ensuring full transparency and compliance from start to finish.\n\nContinuous Risk Updates\n\nStay compliant with evolving regulations, as TradeScreen continuously updates its risk assessment framework in real time.\n\nUser Management Capabilities\n\nEnable role-based access controls to tailor access and permissions across your teams, ensuring data security and governance compliance across workflows.\n\n\nWorkflow Capabilities\n\nSupport for maker-checker workflows, allowing teams to create, review, and approve trade transactions collaboratively.
